# WIP

This project is still under development and was not published to Atmosphere yet!

# useraccounts:pure.css

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for Pure.css

This package depends on [useraccounts:core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core)

Learn more [here](http://useraccounts.meteor.com) or have a look at the full [documentation](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core/blob/master/Guide.md).


## Bring Your Own Pure.css

Adding this package with `meteor add useraccounts:pure.css` does not add any other packages providing Pure.css. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, being it compiled, less, sass, or from CDN!


At the moment it is up to date with Pure.css X.X.X
