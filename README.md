=====================================

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for Pure.css

This package depends on [useraccounts:core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core)

## Bring Your Own CSS

Adding this package with `meteor add useraccounts:pure.css` does not add any css/less/sass rules but for the colors for social login buttons. This is to let you write your own ones!
